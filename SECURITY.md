## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability please [open a new issue](https://github.com/jamesrweb/react-p5-wrapper/issues/new) with the label `security`.
Security issues are a priority and we aim to resolve them within 48 hours. 
If a security vulnerability cannot be resolved by us, we will raise the issue upstream with relevant parties such as 3rd party package managers.
