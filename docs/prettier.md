# Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and re-printing it with its own rules.

## Configuration

There are just a few options that can be configured in Prettier. They can found in a `.prettierrc` file in the project root.

The configuration file contains the following:

- `"trailingComma": "none"`: Print without trailing commas.

See more details in the [documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).

## Usage

Run the following script to format the files with `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx` and `md` extensions:

```
npm run format
```
